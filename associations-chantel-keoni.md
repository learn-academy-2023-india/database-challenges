As a developer, I have been tasked with creating a database to store information for a bank that issues credit cards. The account owner must fill out a bank application that includes their name and address. Then account owners can be issued one or more credit cards. Credit cards must belong to an account owner.

rails g model IndicaHoldings name:string address:string

rails db:migrate

IndicaHolding.create(name: 'John Dough' , address: '123 Ezy
E Street')

‚úîÔ∏è Acceptance Criteria
The banking application data should be managed by a PostgreSQL database in a Rails application.
An account owner should have a name and an address.
IndicaHolding.create(name: 'Pamela Springs' , address: '27 E
lm')

There should be at least three owners in the database.

IndicaHolding.create(name: 'John Dough' , address: '123 Ezy
E Street')

IndicaHolding.create(name: 'Pamela Springs' , address: '27 E
lm')

IndicaHolding.create(name: 'Fredrick Mercury' , address: 'Fr
ansisco District, CA')

class IndicaHolding < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :credit_cards
end

class CreditCard < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :indica_holding
end

A credit card has a number and an expiration date.
john[0].credit_cards.create(card_number: 77776666 ,
3.2.0 :004 > exp_date: 'March 31st, 2031')

Remember! Credit cards CANNOT exist without an account owner.
Think about the purpose of each data type and what characters are necessary in each column. (Example: 02/2023 vs 02-02-2023)
Each account owner should have at least one credit card.

te: 'December 24th, 2023')

At least one account owner should have three credit cards.

queen[0].credit_cards.create(card_number: 44448888 , exp_date: 'September 21st, 1974')

üèî Stretch Goals
Add a credit limit to each card.
Find the total credit extended to an owner who has multiple credit cards.
