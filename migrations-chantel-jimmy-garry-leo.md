As a developer, I can update the values of the five existing database entries to include a unit of time on the run_time column. (Example: '165 minutes' or '1 hr, 45 minutes')
    - > Movie.all.each { |movie| movie.update(run_time: '165 minutes') }

As a developer, I can rename the column category to be named genre.
- in terminal
    -rails generate migration RenameCategoryToGenreInMovies
